## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

If this application is in response to an RFP, please indicate this on the first line of this section.

If this is an application for a follow-up grant (the continuation of an earlier, successful W3F grant), please provide name and/or pull request of said grant on the first line of this section.

### Overview

Subdeeply is a fully decentralized educational social network that will allow the community and users to access information and resources on each of the Polkadot / Kusama chains and the Substrate framework.
We are integrated as a service and tool to access educational resources and information about the Polkadot / Kusama strings and the Substrate framework.

Subdeeply returns control to freedom of expression for all users and freedom of choice for all creators. Problems arising from private ownership of modern mass communication infrastructures. Subdeeply establishes a relationship with the organization of content sources, social aggregation between platforms, quality of user-driven posts, spam control, content monetization and community governance.

Subdeeply aims to increase the adoption of new and potential users towards Polkadot, Kusama chains and Substrate Framework made their adoption and use of their services, our goal is to create a platform that helps users to identify the different services and use cases, implement and provide information about Polkadot and Kusama with the goal that users get involved in blockchains and their technology, get to know the different services they offer, learn how to use them and subsequently dynamize the blockchain ecosystem through more active users.

- Relevant prior work or research on the topic

Subdeeply is a scalable project, and may become profitable in the future. There is nothing similar to Subdeeply, the only direct competition would be the conventional media, but they only publish information related to news, not education. Subdeeply is not intended to be a conventional media, the goal is to apply blockchain technology to education, and apply decentralized education as a framework towards the Web3 future. Blockchain education is still in its early stages.

### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Polkadot/Substrate/Kusama landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?

The project fits into global communities, investors and users by offering users access to information media and educational resources allowing users to identify the different types of uses and services of Polkadot, Kusama and Substrate.

- Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?

Investors, communities, developers, gamers and all communities.

- What need(s) does your project meet?
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem?
  - If so, how is your project different?

Blockchain education is still in its early stages, there are no services or platform like Subdeeply. As a general idea, it is good to have educational hubs, and subdeeply aims to provide the gateway to impact blockchain education, and drive adoption.

  - If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?

## Future Plans

Please include here

- how you intend to use, enhance, promote and support your project in the short term, and
- the team's long-term plans and intentions in relation to it.

Subdeeply aims to build a platform that helps drive blockchain education towards web3, offering a service for global communities and integrating tools for users to identify and learn about the uses and services of blockchains.

We focus on creating a platform that drives the adoption of services in Polkadot, Kusama and Substrate ecosystems. Attract investors and potential users. In the short term we will prioritize the development of the platform so that it does not present any kind of difficulties and affect the user experience on the platform.

In the longer term, we will implement a business model based on advertising or premium features, some of these features include subscriptions or plans, or a native ecosystem itself. These market strategies are sustainable, we believe that blockchain education is continuously evolving and in the future there will be more services like subdeeply, we want to incorporate features to support the adoption of Polkadot / Kusama chains ecosystems and Substrate Protocol.
